# Priority #1: finalize the 1st version of the game

# Important
-Simple AI

-Building construction time
-OBS won't react to changing to fullscreen

# Bugs
-Worker>building shortcut>no fow check

# Not very important
-Construction sprites should move after the key was pressed
-Selection of closest unit. Makes it easier to catch moving units
-Stop doesn't stop workers from working
-Workers that spawned near minerals cannot mine them
-Selected info
-Spawning in the direction of the rally point?
-World editor? Required for terrain pos_coords
-Diagonal movement interception: if not fixed, it will be possible for up to 4 units to have the same coordinate (2 ground, 2 air). Only required for save/load.
-Fix minimap
-Screen edge cam scrolling
-Idle units should check for close enemies only when an enemy moves or is spawned (useless optimization?)
-Something should indicate that there is a ground unit present below an air unit
-Shift for selecting ground units below air units?
-Make building spawn units only every 60 frames

# Ideas
-None
