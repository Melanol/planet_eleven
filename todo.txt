# Important
-Building construction time
-Requirement for units
-Make it work for almost any resolution
-Add win and defeat conditions and screens
-Make in-game text output
-Get rid of windowed mode

# Notes
-Hotkey construction works only for fullscreen

# Bugs
-Minimap clicks create float viewport coords
-Move command is crazy (check viewports)
-Building location selection is broken sometimes. Caused by movement interruption. Creates a selectable block of the worker
-Fullscreen minimap panning is not working properly
-Workers that spawned near minerals cannot mine them
-Stop doesn't stop workers from gathering
-Menu buttons are sometimes broken after changing the screen mode
-Cannot move units to the bottom left corner in 800x600
-The viewport is broken sometimes in 1024x768: cannot move the viewport to the top right corner, viewport step brakes to 16 instead of 32 if you try
-Exit button is broken sometimes
-Right-click cancel does not refund minerals

# Not very important
-Hotkeys for building units
-Make minimap pixels at least 3 pixels wide
-Rename vultures
-Red-styled control panel
-Attack range using blocks, not centers: optimize enemy detection
-Optimize mineral gathering and popping out units
-A label for outputting error messages
-Selection of closest unit. Makes it easier to catch moving units. Not needed with multiple unit selection
-Selected info
-Spawning in the direction of the rally point?
-World editor? Required for terrain pos_coords
-Diagonal movement interception: if not fixed, it will be possible for up to 4 units to have the same coordinate (2 ground, 2 air). Only required for save/load.
-Screen edge cam scrolling
-Idle units should check for close enemies only when an enemy moves or is spawned (useless optimization?)
-Something should indicate that there is a ground unit present below an air unit
-Shift for selecting ground units under air units?
-Get rid of small windowed mode
-Construction sprite does not move to the cursor after using a bulding hotkey

# Absolutely not important
-Update menu buttons with new letters

# Ideas
-Cython? The game is too slow on old PCs
