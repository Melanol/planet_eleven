# Priority #1: finalize the 1st version of the game

# Important
-Unit control buttons
-AI
-Building costs and building time
-Building 2-block-wide buldings
-There is a bug that does not allow you to select units that are in the right top corner of the map (probably a viewport movement bug)
-Make building spawn units only every 60 frames
-Ordering a building at a loc where a unit will be spawned messes up things

# Not important
-Nexus animation
-Selected info
-Spawning in the direction of the rally point?
-World editor? Required for terrain pos_coords
-Diagonal movement interception: if not fixed, it will be possible for up to 4 units to have the same coordinate (2 ground, 2 air)
-Finalize minimap
-Screen edge cam scrolling
-Implement in-game id?
-Units should check for close enemies only when an enemy moves or is spawned (useless optimization?)
-Something should indicate that there is a ground unit present below an air unit
-Shift for selecting ground units below air units?
-HP bars?

# Ideas
-None
