# Priority #1: finalize the 1st version of the game

# Important
-Unit control buttons
-AI
-Building costs and building time
-Building 2-block-wide buldings
-There is a bug that does not allow you to select units that are in the right top corner of the map
-Make building spawn units only every 60 secs
-Enemy units can shoot our units after locking on them from any distance
-After 5 mins of letting AI build workers non-stop, FPS drops to 5, and memory usage increases. Looks like garbage collection is not working for workers or projectiles. I think it's the workers.
-Rally-point moving like 20 workers to a distant location significantly lowers FPS. Killem them does not this this. Movement significantly lowers FPS, but only workers do not fix this after stopping (tried vulture)
-Workers rotate strangely while building

# Not important
-Units blink-rotate the moment they are ordered to move
-Selected info
-Spawning in the direction of the rally point?
-World editor? Required for terrain pos_coords
-Diagonal movement interception: if not fixed, it will be possible for up to 4 units to have the same coordinate (2 ground, 2 air)
-Finalize minimap
-Screen edge cam scrolling
-Implement in-game id?
-Units should check for close enemies only when an enemy moves or is spawned (useless optimization?)
-Something should indicate that there is a ground unit present below an air unit
-Shift for selecting ground units below air units?
-HP bars?

# Ideas
-None
