# Important
-A bit smarter AI
-Make sure players play at least 2 hours kek (bad Melanol)

-Building construction time
-Requirement for units
-OBS won't react to changing to fullscreen
-Fix the minimap already!
-Make it work for almost any resolution

# Bugs
-Building location selection is broken sometimes. Caused by movement interruption. Creates a selectable block of the worker
-Fullscreen minimap panning is not working properly
-Workers that spawned near minerals cannot mine them

# Not very important
-Red control panel
-Fullscreen on/off should be moved to options
-Attack range using blocks, not centers: optimize enemy detection
-Optimize mineral gathering and popping out units
-Change back to proper fullscreen
-A label for outputting error messages
-Selection of closest unit. Makes it easier to catch moving units
-Stop doesn't stop workers from gathering
-Selected info
-Spawning in the direction of the rally point?
-World editor? Required for terrain pos_coords
-Diagonal movement interception: if not fixed, it will be possible for up to 4 units to have the same coordinate (2 ground, 2 air). Only required for save/load.
-Screen edge cam scrolling
-Idle units should check for close enemies only when an enemy moves or is spawned (useless optimization?)
-Something should indicate that there is a ground unit present below an air unit
-Shift for selecting ground units under air units?
