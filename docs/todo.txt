# Important
-Building construction time
-Requirement for entities
-Make it work for almost any resolution
-Add win and defeat conditions and screens
-Make fullscreen streamable
-On-entity attack command
-Multi-layer sprites for entities (team colors)
-Shadow generator for units

# Notes
-Hotkey construction frame autoupdate works only for fullscreen
-Chess board limits the number of combinations

# Bugs
-Minimap clicks create float viewport coords
-Move command is crazy (check viewports)
-Building location selection is broken sometimes. Caused by movement interruption. Creates a selectable block of the worker
-Fullscreen minimap panning is not working properly
-Workers that spawned near minerals cannot mine them
-Stop doesn't stop workers from gathering
-Menu buttons are sometimes broken after changing screen mode
-Cannot move units to the bottom left corner in 800x600
-The viewport is broken sometimes in 1024x768: cannot move the viewport to the top right corner, viewport step brakes to 16 instead of 32 if you try
-Exit button is broken sometimes
-Right-click cancel does not refund minerals
-Selected hp text x is not consistent

# Not very important
-Faster projectiles
-Apocalypse should fire non-linked bomb (one can evade them by moving away)
-Multiple inheritance for ctrustures instead of crazy nesting
-Hotkeys for building units
-Make minimap pixels at least 3 pixels wide
-Red-styled control panel
-Attack range using blocks, not centers: optimize enemy detection (useless optimization?)
-Optimize mineral gathering and popping out units
-A label for outputting error messages
-Selection of closest unit. Makes it easier to catch moving units. Not needed with multiple unit selection
-Spawning in the direction of the rally point?
-World editor? Required for terrain pos_coords
-Diagonal movement interception: if not fixed, it will be possible for up to 4 units to have the same coordinate (2 ground, 2 air). Only required for save/load.
-Screen edge cam scrolling
-Idle units should check for close enemies only when an enemy moves or is spawned (useless optimization?)
-Something should indicate that there is a ground unit present below an air unit
-Visual click feedback
-Decaying bodies

# Absolutely not important
-Update menu buttons with new letters

# Ideas
-Cython? The game is too slow on old PCs
-Units should start attacking simultaneously
